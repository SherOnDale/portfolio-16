# coding_challenge-16

This coding challenge is all about **design and building a portfolio project to wow your future customers/employers**. When I first started out as a developer, making websites look "good" was the hardest part. What was modern? What looked sleek? What type of design makes you look like a high quality developer? This challenge tackles that question, so that after you complete it, you know the answers to those questios.

Please Use the **#coding-challenge** channel on Discord to discuss and share your work. At the end of the challenge, I will compile everyone's submitted websites on here.

## Prizes!

This challenge is kindly sponsored by [Creative Tim](https://www.creative-tim.com/)! The top 3 entries of this challenge who will be selected by Creative Tim staff and myself will **each win the [Big Bundle](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/buy/bundle/big-bundle) which has a \$3,341 value each**. Winners will be announced a few weeks after the coding challenge ends.

## What is the Challenge?

Build a beautiful website (it could be your portfolio, or any type of a project you can think of) that is single page. However, you will have to build it using modern design techniques. What does that mean? Well, you need to follow these 3 resources:

1. https://onepagelove.com/
2. https://zen-of-programming.com/kickass-portfolio/
3. [2019 Design Trends](https://uxplanet.org/2019-ui-and-ux-design-trends-92dfa8323225)

Once you have gone through those 3 above, you can go ahead and download a starter template: [free template](https://www.creative-tim.com/bootstrap-themes/ui-kit?direction=asc&sort=price) from Creative Tim, and start building your single page website! Remember: the idea/website can be anything. You will be judged on the design and creativity!

## The Rules Are:

1. You HAVE TO use a [free template](https://www.creative-tim.com/bootstrap-themes/ui-kit?direction=asc&sort=price) from Creative Tim (but choose whichever one you want). You will use this to start off the project but you can customaize or add/remove to it whatever you like afterwards. Be creative.

2. **You have until April 30th at 11:59pm EST** to submit your solution file (using Github. If you don't know how to do that, check out the lecture in the Git + Github section of the course). You will have to submit the link to the **#coding-challenge** Discord group with the following message: _-challenge URL LINK TO YOUR ENTRY"_ . The bot will listen for the command in any channel it is in and will reply with "thanks for your submission" if it succeeded.

3. Use whatever tools you have as developers (google, friends, Discord, programming buddy etc...) but I will not be offering any help with this challenge. Just like a developer, you must solve a problem and build something that will be challenging. Nobody will hold your hand during the job so we want to experience that by figuring it all out on your own with your team.

**\* **Please note: As with all my challenges there is zero benefit or monetary gain I recieve from it. This is just my way of thanking my students and making sure that you are able to continue gaining valuable knowledge outside of just my videos. It would mean a lot to me if you are able to rate my course...5 star reviews make my day :)\*\*
